# Productivity-Workflow-Tools-


**Productivity & Workflow Tools:**
Build tools that save time, reduce friction, or simplify everyday tasks - for developers or anyone else. If it boosts your flow, it fits here. Examples: dev workflow automations, resume helpers, content tools, calendar organizers


Requirements
What to Build
Build a working software application that uses Kiro and submit it into one of the following categories:

Productivity & Workflow Tools:
Build tools that save time, reduce friction, or simplify everyday tasks - for developers or anyone else. If it boosts your flow, it fits here. Examples: dev workflow automations, resume helpers, content tools, calendar organizers
Games & Entertainment:
Make something expressive, interactive, or just plain fun! Examples: Games, interactive storytelling experiences, visual experiments, etc.
Educational Apps:
Build something that helps others learn. Examples: Interactive tutorials, onboarding tools, or AI-enhanced learning platforms, etc.
Wildcard / Freestyle:
Doesn’t fit the categories above? This is your category. Build anything with Kiro - we love surprises
What to Submit
Include a three (3) minute demonstration video of your submission. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video and made public and judges are not required to watch beyond 3 minutes.
Video must answer the following questions:
For building and vibe coding from scratch: How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?
For agent hooks: What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?
For spec-to-code: How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process?
Your repo must contain the /.kiro directory at the root of the project to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering. Do NOT add the /.kiro directory or sub-folders to your .gitignore, as this could disqualify your submission.
Provide a URL to your open source code repository for judging and testing. 
The code repository must be public with an approved OSI Open Source License.
Identify which project category you are submitting to.
Include a write up on how Kiro was used.








Certainly! You're participating in a **Kiro hackathon** under the **"Productivity & Workflow Tools"** category, and the requirements involve building a working software app using Kiro (an AI IDE that helps generate code via conversations/specs/hooks).

## ✅ Objective

**Build a software app** using **Kiro** that:

* **Saves time**, **reduces friction**, or **simplifies daily tasks**
* Belongs in the **Productivity & Workflow Tools** category (e.g., dev automation, content tools, calendar organizers, etc.)
* Uses Kiro’s key features: `specs`, `agent hooks`, or `steering`
* Is open source and demoed in a **3-minute video**

---

## 🧱 Project Planning Overview (Step-by-Step)

### **🔹 Step 1: Ideation – Pick a Project Idea**

Pick a productivity tool idea that fits the theme. A few examples:

* ✅ **Resume Helper** (uploads resume, gets AI tips, generates improvements)
* ✅ **Daily Standup Bot** (asks devs for updates, compiles, posts to Slack)
* ✅ **Meeting Summarizer & Scheduler** (summarizes meetings + schedules follow-ups)
* ✅ **GitHub PR Assistant** (analyzes PRs and suggests code review responses)

➡️ Let’s choose one to guide you with. Example: **"Daily Standup Bot"**

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Define the Workflow / Features**

Clearly describe what the app does, either in plain English or a feature checklist.

For "Daily Standup Bot":

1. User receives a daily prompt (e.g., via Slack or web UI)
2. Answers 3 questions: yesterday’s progress, today’s plan, blockers
3. Bot compiles team responses into a report
4. Sends report to a Slack channel or emails it to manager

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Convert to Kiro Spec**

Now write a **Kiro spec file** that tells Kiro what to build. Example (spec):

```yaml
name: daily-standup-bot
description: A tool that automates daily standups and sends reports to Slack
features:
  - Prompt users every morning for daily standup
  - Collect answers to 3 questions
  - Generate team summary report
  - Send summary to Slack using webhook
technologies:
  - backend: Node.js (Express)
  - frontend: React with Tailwind
  - integration: Slack API
```

You’ll place this spec in your repo under:

```
/.kiro/specs/daily-standup-bot.yaml
```

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Start Coding with Kiro**

Use Kiro’s conversational interface:

1. Upload the above spec
2. Ask: **“Generate backend server with endpoints to collect user standup data”**
3. Ask: **“Generate frontend UI for users to submit their standup”**
4. Ask: **“Write a function to send a message to a Slack channel”**

Kiro will help by auto-generating routes, UI components, integration functions.

🧠 **Pro Tip:** Use short prompts like:

* "Generate MongoDB schema for standup entries"
* "Add cron job to send daily summary to Slack at 10am"

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Add Agent Hooks (if needed)**

Use **agent hooks** for automating workflows.

Example hooks for this project:

* `"onCron('daily-10am')"` → Generate and send report
* `"onUserSubmit()"` → Save response to DB and confirm submission

Kiro will create these hooks inside:

```
/.kiro/hooks/
```

---

### **🔹 Step 6: Run and Test the App**

1. Set up local environment:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
2. Test:

   * User submits standup entry
   * Summary is generated
   * Slack receives message

---

### **🔹 Step 7: Record Demo Video (3 Min Max)**

Record a screen demo covering:

* How you used **Kiro specs / prompts / hooks**
* Most impressive code Kiro helped generate
* Live demo of app running

💡 Tools to record: OBS Studio, Loom, or Zoom recording
📺 Upload to YouTube (public) with a proper title & description

---

### **🔹 Step 8: Open Source + Submission**

1. Push code to GitHub:

   * ✅ Include: `.kiro/` folder with specs/hooks
   * ✅ Use: Open source license (MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.)
2. In the README:

   * App name + description
   * Steps to run locally
   * How you used Kiro (add a short write-up)
   * Video demo link
   * Category: Productivity & Workflow Tools
