What to Submit

Video must answer the following questions:

For agent hooks: What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?
For spec-to-code: How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process?
Your repo must contain the /.kiro directory at the root of the project to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering. Do NOT add the /.kiro directory or sub-folders to your .gitignore, as this could disqualify your submission.
